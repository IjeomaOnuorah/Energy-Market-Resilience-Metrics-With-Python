## Datasets
1. Historical Energy Data
  - Fields: Energy demand, consumption, price, production.
  - Purpose: Analyze historical trends in energy usage and pricing.
2. Infrastructure Data
  - Fields: Maintenance records, infrastructure status, technology limitations.
  - Purpose: Assess the state of energy infrastructure and its impact.
3. Market Data
  - Fields: Market price, competitor data, demand trends.
  - Purpose: Understand market dynamics and competitive positioning.

## Getting Started
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**:
Handled missing values using mean/median imputation or dropping incomplete rows.
Standardized column names for consistency across datasets.
- **Data Transformation**:
Converted date columns to datetime format.
Normalized numerical columns to bring all values into a similar scale for analysis.
- **Outlier Detection**:
Identified outliers using the Z-score and IQR methods.
Filtered or flagged anomalous entries for further investigation.
